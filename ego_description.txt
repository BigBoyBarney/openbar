Top Bar ( Top Panel ) customization / styling. Open the Top Bar and let the colors üçπ flow.

Update : 
- Addition of auto-generated Desktop Background color palette in every color palette pop up. Note: you may have to change the background once so that the extension can capture the signal to identify the image for background.
- Enhancements in fonts, highlights, backgrounds etc and new padding controls
- Many fixes and compatibility with other extensions like QSAP, Arc Menu etc
- Some users had reported extension crashes/error due to the Panel being modified by other extensions. Known cases are already fixed. If you find anything new, please report in Github.

Feedback / suggestions are welcome.

If the panel/menu isn't looking right, you need to tweak some settings. There are a lot of knobs to allow for differnt setups/tastes. It can also make it a bit overwhelming if you are not familiar with css styles but with some experimentation it will become a lot easier. Here are brief notes:
- BG/FG color: Background or Foreground colors. Foreground is typically text and icons.
- Alpha: Transparency for the color. 0 is transparent while 1 is opaque.
- Panel BG will affect the bar while Islands BG will affect the individual indicator buttons/combos (in Islands mode).
- Gradient goes from Start color to End color. If you want a single color fading, select same color for both with differnt Alphas. e.g. Setting end color alpha to 0 will form a gradient from Start color to transparent.
- Highlight color: It is the background color upon hover or focus. 
- Vertical padding: Controls size of highlights in Mainland/Floating. Also controls size of Islands/Trilands. Increase height if padding squeezes the text.
- Panel Shadow: a downward shadow for the panel bar. Shadow Spread controls both shadow trasparency and spread together.
- Border: 
    = Width controls thickness (grows inwards for Islands). Adjust bar height accordingly, after setting border width.  
    = Radius will control the shape from rectangle at radius 0 to Pill at radius close to bar height. 
    = Neon glow: adds a neon-light like glow to the border. You need dark, relatively opaque background with bright/neon colored, relatively opaque border. Neon will override Panel shadow in Mainland and Floating mode.
 - Menus: 
    = FG/BG, border, highlight are similar to above but for menus.
    = Selected/active color is for menu items that are active e.g. Today's day in Calendar or WiFi in Quick Settings or even an active menu item with opened submenu. 
    = Shadow applies to the panel menu. Use white/bright color in dark theme and black/dark color in light theme for the effect to show and help with contrast. Using same color as menu border is also a good idea. Use the Alphas for both border and shadow to increase or reduce their effect.
    = Once enabled, menu settings now also apply as soon as changed. You need to press 'Apply Menu Styles' button to enable the menu style. 'Reset Menu Styles' button will remove all menu styles and revert to your default theme.

Lastly, be a tiny bit gentler with the sliders in the settings as they modify the stylesheet behind the scene for every update.
